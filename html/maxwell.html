%% Maxwell Documentation
% Welcome to the official documentation for Maxwell!
% If something seems to be missing, just use <http://ask.lightlabs.co>.
%%

%% Hello! from the creators of Maxwell.
% 
% Hi, we're Jesse and Wonseok, co-founders at Lightlabs.co and the guys behind Maxwell. We built Maxwell to turbo-charge our research as PhD students at Stanford, and we hope it boosts whatever your working on as well!
% 
% We continue to work hard on making Maxwell the most powerful and enjoyable tool in your computational toolbox, and so if you ever have any questions, or if there's ever anything you need help with regarding Maxwell, please bring it up on <ask.lightlabs.co>, which is forwarded to our inboxes.
%
% 
% Thank you for taking the time to get to know Maxwell!

%% A quick taste of Maxwell
% 
% Okay, let's cut straight to the chase and give you a little taste of Maxwell right off the bat.
%
% First, here's an overview of what a (short) Maxwell session might look like.

eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release')) % Load Maxwell.

% Get your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ready.
maxwell.aws_credentials('access-key-id', 'secret-access-key'); 

% Launch a Maxwell cluster on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.
maxwell.launch('cluster1', 4); % A 4-node cluster.

% Solve an electromagnetic simulation on the cluster.
maxwell.solve('cluster1', 4, {simulation_parameters});% Use all 4-nodes.

% Terminate the Maxwell cluster.
maxwell.terminate('cluster1');

%%
% Now, as an overview, you've reached the documentation of Maxwell, which consists only of the five |maxwell.*| commands above. However, when you load Maxwell, a powerful dynamic grid interface is also included.
%
% Just a few things you should know to get your hands around Maxwell:
%
% * Maxwell must be loaded everytime you start Matlab, use |eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release'))| to load Maxwell in just one command.
% * Maxwell is open-source, you can access the code yourself at <http://www.github.com/JesseLu/lightlabs-maxwell>.
% * This document has three main sections: Quick-start/tutorial, a cloud-computing deep-dive, and a numerical electromagnetics deep-dive. Use the deep-dive sections to really understand what's going on beneath the hood.
% * If you ever have any questions, use <http://ask.lightlabs.co>.
%

%% Quick-start
% Now that you have an idea of how Maxwell is used, why don't we guide you through an actual simulation on your Matlab session, so you can see how things look live?
%
% Just to make sure we're on the same page, you probably already have Maxwell loaded, but if you're ever doubtful, running the following never hurts:

eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release')) % One-command load.

%% 
% *First off, you'll need your AWS Access Credentials*, which you can obtain at <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials#access_credentials>. In particular, you're looking for an active _Access Key ID_ and it's corresponding _Secret Access Key_. Of course, if you don't have an AWS account you'll need to sign up for one first.
% 
% Once you have your eye on your AWS credentials, then you'll want to copy-and-paste them into Maxwell's |aws_credentials| function like so:
% 
%   maxwell.aws_credentials('access-key-id', 'secret-access-key');
%
% Take the following as an example:

maxwell.aws_credentials('AKIAJLYFDI6ZYE6WKU', '0Mi2d8MT9Uo8+P0VVmOVV2XdbOxv5UarS2rSaI');

%%
% Believe it or not, that's the only adminstrative task that we make you do. So with that our of the way, let's get on with the fun stuff, like actually launching a cluster!
%
% *To launch a cluster*, just choose a name for it, and the number of computational nodes you want it to have. Having a cluster name allows you to juggle multiple clusters (when you want to get fancy), and, as expected, the more worker nodes a cluster has, the more computational power is at its disposal.
%
% For our purposes, let's call our cluster 'cluster1', and boot it up with 2 worker nodes.

% This is how we launch clusters on Amazon EC2. Takes about 5 minutes.
maxwell.launch('cluster1', 2); % Yes, that's it. Really.

%%
% Cluster launches on EC2 take about 5 minutes, so while you're waiting let us tell you more about what the cluster actually consists of.
%
% Each cluster consists of one master node, and as many worker nodes as you want (or Amazon will let you have). Specifically, each worker node contains two Nvidia GPUs and, in EC2 lingo, are |cg1.4xlarge| spot request instances. Maxwell actually uses these GPUs to accelerate our solver, more on that in a later section though.
%
% While the cluster is still booting up, please visit <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=Instances> where you can manually monitor the launch process (also try clicking on "Spot Requests" on the left sidebar).
%
% When the launch is successfully completed, you are ready (after only two lines of Matlab mind you!) to start solving electromagnetic simulations! We'll show you how to do this in two ways, first using the _synchronous_ solve function and then using its _asynchronous_ sibling.
%
% Now, just so you know, we won't cover the nitty-gritty of how we describe electromagnetic simulations until a later section; instead, we'll use the |example_simulation_parameters| function that comes with your Maxwell toolbox to generate them for us.
%
% *So, without further ado, let's solve an electromagnetic simulation!*

params = example_simulation_parameters([60 60 60]); % Let's start small (60x60x60 cells).
[E, H] = maxwell.solve('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % Go baby, go! Notice that we only use 1 node.

%% 
% You should get a plot similar to the one below.
%
% <<60x60x60.png>>
%
% And upon inspecting the solution using

imagesc(real(E{3}(:,:,30)')); axis equal tight;

%%
% you should obtain the (near-field) radiation pattern of a dipole.
%
% <<60x60x60_Ez.png>>
%

%% 
% Now that you're getting the hang of simulating, why not try something bigger?

params = example_simulation_parameters([200 200 60]); 
[E, H] = maxwell.solve('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % Solve using 1 node.
[E, H] = maxwell.solve('cluster1', 2, params{:}); % Now solve using 2 nodes (faster!).

%%
% So what's going on now? Well, besides simulating a larger space, we're comparing using either 1 or 2 nodes of the cluster (which has a total of 2 nodes) to solve the simulation. Naturally, the simulation which uses 2 nodes should run faster, although not nearly twice as fast (there is some communication cost which cannot be hidden).
%
% At this point, you may be wondering why anyone would _not_ use all the worker nodes available for each simulation. Great question! To answer it, let me introduce you to Maxwell's asynchronous solve capabilities.
%
% *Maxwell's asynchronous solve accepts the same input parameters*, but instead of blocking until the simulation is completed, a callback function is returned. This callback function should then be repeatedly called in order to get updates on the progress of the simulation, and to download the result once the simulation is completed. 
%
% This is illustrated with the simple example below:

params = example_simulation_parameters([200 200 60]);  
sim_finish = maxwell.solve_async('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % Asynchronous solve!
while ~sim_finish(); end % Loop until sim_finish() returns true, signalling simulation completion.
[is_done, E, H] = sim_finish(); % Download the solution fields.

%%
% What's so great about the asynchronous solve function is that it enables you to run multiple simulations in parallel!
%
% Take a look at this next example, which utilizes our 2-node cluster to simulate 2 simulations in parallel (1 node each):

params = example_simulation_parameters([200 200 60]);  

% Note that the subplot commands are needed so that the progress plots display in separate axes.
subplot 121; sim1 = maxwell.solve_async('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % Send a simulation to cluster1,
subplot 122; sim2 = maxwell.solve_async('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % and immediately send another, before the first even completes.

while ~all([sim1(), sim2()]); end % Monitor simulations until completed.

% Get our results.
[is_done1, E1, H1] = sim1();
[is_done2, E2, H2] = sim2();

%%
% I hope you are starting to get excited about the possibilities that Maxwell opens up! Namely, that supercomputer-like powers are available from simple Matlab sessions!
%
% Now, I want you to try one more thing before we finish up. Remember how our cluster consists of only 2 nodes? What happens if we over-subscribe our cluster by asking it to solve two simulations using 2 nodes each? Try it out for yourself!

params = example_simulation_parameters([200 200 60]);  
subplot 121; sim1 = maxwell.solve_async('cluster1', 2, params{:}); % This simulation asks for 2 nodes now.
subplot 122; sim2 = maxwell.solve_async('cluster1', 2, params{:}); % as does this one.

while ~all([sim1(), sim2()]); end % Monitor simulations until completed.

%%
% *As you've probably guessed, Maxwell clusters have a built-in scheduling system*. This system stores all simulation requests in a queue, and then executes them on various nodes as these become available. In other words, you can basically throw as many simulations as you like at a Maxwell cluster, and they will all eventually be processed! This allows you to fully utilize the cluster by making sure it is always busy. And, of course, you don't need to wait for any simulations to finish if you use the asynchronous solve function.

% *Now that you've seen how Maxwell works, we can terminate our cluster*. To manually monitor cluster termination, use <http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/>. Once you have your browser there, click on |Instances| in the left side-bar, and then terminate your cluster (from Matlab, of course) like so:

maxwell.terminate('cluster1'); % Bye-bye for now.

%%
% Just a couple more words about cluster termination. If a launch is botched, be sure to still attempt a termination, so that the failed launch will be cleaned up. And that's it! Congrats on completing Maxwell's quick-start!

%% Understanding Maxwell: using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
%
% Maxwell makes use of Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service in order to deliver supercomputer-like powers to your local Matlab installation. The purpose of this section is to help you understand exactly how this happens.
%
% *The first thing to understand is that Maxwell uses your own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to launch/terminate clusters*. Although we operate a control server to aid in this process, the clusters are run using your AWS account (that's why you can monitor launches manually through your own AWS console, for instance). This also means that all billing runs through Amazon, we never touch or see your charge card.
%
% *Secondly, know that Maxwell is cryptographically secure*. All the communication involved in Maxwell is encrypted, from the launch/terminate commands to the uploading/downloading of simulation information.
%
% With the understanding of these two basic ideas, we are now ready to understand what remains of how Maxwell uses EC2.
