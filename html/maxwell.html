%% Maxwell Documentation
% Welcome to the official documentation for Maxwell!
% If something seems to be missing, just use <http://ask.lightlabs.co>.
%%

%% Hello! from the creators of Maxwell.
% 
% Hi, we're Jesse and Wonseok, co-founders at Lightlabs.co and the guys behind Maxwell. We built Maxwell to turbo-charge our research as PhD students at Stanford, and we hope it boosts whatever your working on as well!
% 
% We continue to work hard on making Maxwell the most powerful and enjoyable tool in your computational toolbox, and so if you ever have any questions, or if there's ever anything you need help with regarding Maxwell, please bring it up on <ask.lightlabs.co>, which is forwarded to our inboxes.
% 
% Thank you for taking the time to get to know Maxwell!

%% A quick taste of Maxwell
% 
% Okay, let's cut straight to the chase and give you a little taste of Maxwell right off the bat.
%
% First, here's an overview of what a (short) Maxwell session might look like.

% Get your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials ready.
maxwell.aws_credentials('access-key-id', 'secret-access-key'); 

% Launch a Maxwell cluster on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.
maxwell.launch('cluster1', 4); % A 4-node cluster.

% Solve an electromagnetic simulation on the cluster.
maxwell.solve('cluster1', 4, {simulation_parameters});% Use all 4-nodes.

% Terminate the Maxwell cluster.
maxwell.terminate('cluster1');

%% Quick-start
% Now that you have an idea of how Maxwell is used, why don't we guide you through an actual simulation on your Matlab session, so you can see how things look live?
% 
% First off, you'll need your AWS Access Credentials, which you can obtain at <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials#access_credentials>. In particular, you're looking for an active _Access Key ID_ and it's corresponding _Secret Access Key_. Of course, if you don't have an AWS account you'll need to sign up for one first.
% 
% Once you have your eye on your AWS credentials, then you'll want to copy-and-paste them into Maxwell's |aws_credentials| function like so:
% 
%   maxwell.aws_credentials('access-key-id', 'secret-access-key');
%
% Take the following as an example:

maxwell.aws_credentials('AKIAJLYFDI6ZYE6WKU', '0Mi2d8MT9Uo8+P0VVmOVV2XdbOxv5UarS2rSaI');

%%
% Believe it or not, that's the only adminstrative task that we make you do. So with that our of the way, let's get on with the fun stuff, like actually launching a cluster!
%
% To launch a cluster, just choose a name for it, and the number of computational nodes you want it to have. Having a cluster name allows you to juggle multiple clusters (when you want to get fancy), and, as expected, the more worker nodes a cluster has, the more computational power is at its disposal.
%
% For our purposes, let's call our cluster 'cluster1', and boot it up with 2 worker nodes.

% This is how we launch clusters on Amazon EC2. Takes about 5 minutes.
maxwell.launch('cluster1', 2); % Yes, that's it. Really.

%%
% Cluster launches on EC2 take about 5 minutes, so while you're waiting let us tell you more about what the cluster actually consists of.
%
% Each cluster consists of one master node, and as many worker nodes as you want (or Amazon will let you have). Specifically, each worker node contains two Nvidia GPUs and, in EC2 lingo, are |cg1.4xlarge| spot request instances. Maxwell actually uses these GPUs to accelerate our solver, more on that in a later section though.
%
% While the cluster is still booting up, please visit <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=Instances> where you can manually monitor the launch process (also try clicking on "Spot Requests" on the left sidebar).
%
% When the launch is successfully completed, you are ready (after only two lines of Matlab mind you!) to start solving electromagnetic simulations! We'll show you how to do this in two ways, first using the synchronous solve function and then using its asynchronous sibling.
%
% Now, just so you know, we won't cover the nitty-gritty of how we describe electromagnetic simulations until a later section; instead, we'll use the |example_simulation_parameters| function that comes with your Maxwell toolbox to generate them for us.
%
% So, without further ado, let's solve an electromagnetic simulation!

params = example_simulation_parameters([60 60 60]); % Let's start small (60x60x60 cells).
maxwell.solve('cluster1', 1, params{:}); % Go baby, go!
