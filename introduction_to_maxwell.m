%   Welcome to Maxwell!
%   -------------------
%
%   You are now at most a few minutes away from running cloud-powered
%   electromagnetic simulations directly from Matlab!
%
%   You have the Matlab part of the deal, now you just need to get the cloud 
%   part. To do that you only need to:
%
%       1. <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials?#access_credentials">Get your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Credentials</a> 
%           If you haven't signed up for an AWS account yet, you can do so at 
%           this step. A <a href="http://www.iorad.com/?a=app.embed&remote=true&accessCode=GUEST&module=4897&mt=How-to-get-your-AWS-credentials">step-by-step tutorial</a> is available for this step 
%           (may need to be opened outside of Matlab).
%           
%       2. <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/user/subscription/index.html?ie=UTF8&offeringCode=C1FC9088">Purchase the Maxwell subscription from Amazon payments</a> 
%           The subscription will send $0.99/hr to lightlabs.co on top of 
%           the usual AWS charges for each cluster you use.
