%   Welcome to Maxwell!
%   -------------------
%
%   You are now at most a few minutes away from running cloud-powered
%   electromagnetic simulations directly from Matlab!
%
%   You have the Matlab part of the deal, now you just need to get the cloud 
%   part. To do that you only need to:
%
%       1. <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials?#access_credentials">Get your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Access Keys</a> 
%           Specifically, you need your "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key",
%           which will be used to launch and terminate Maxwell clusters.
%           If you haven't signed up for an AWS account yet, you can do so at 
%           this step. Also, a <a href="http://www.iorad.com/?a=app.embed&remote=true&accessCode=GUEST&module=4897&mt=How-to-get-your-AWS-credentials">step-by-step tutorial</a> is available for this step 
%           (may need to be opened outside of Matlab).
%           
%   And that's it! Just a few words before we let you loose.
%   
%       We don't mess up your system -- i.e. you need to reload Maxwell every 
%       time you start Matlab. Do this quickly using:
%           <a href="matlab: fprintf('')">eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release'))</a>
%       Note: Automate by adding it to your <a href="matlab:doc startup">startup.m</a> file.
%
%       <a href="matlab:showdemo maxwell">Read the docs!</a> Full documentation including Quick-start is there.
