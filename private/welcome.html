    ...your light simulation supercomputer.


    What is Maxwell?
    ----------------

    Maxwell supercharges your Matlab installation with the power of Amazon's Elastic 
    Compute Cloud to enable it to solve full 3D electromagnetic simulations.

    Maxwell: harnessing the cloud to understand light -- all directly in Matlab!

    The best way to learn about Maxwell is to <a href="matlab: eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release'))">download and install the toolbox</a>,
    which only takes a second and is completely free (and open source)!

    So what are you waiting for... 
        ...<a href="matlab: eval(urlread('http://m.lightlabs.co/pre-release'))">start harnessing the power of the cloud now!</a>
